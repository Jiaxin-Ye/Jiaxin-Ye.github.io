Hi! Here is **Jiaxin Ye ([叶嘉鑫]())**.

I'm a first-year Ph.D. student majoring in Biomedical Engineering (*BME*) at ISTBI, Fudan University, advised by [Dr. Shan](http://hmshan.io/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Intelligent Science and Technology (*AI*) from Xiamen University in 2022. My research interests focus on computer vision and affective computing.

Here is [my CV](https://caihanlin.com/file/CV-HanlinCAI.pdf).
